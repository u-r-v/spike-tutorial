# Spike Prime Python: The Ultimate Interactive Challenge Guide
Welcome to the exciting world of robotics! This repository contains the source for a single-page interactive guide to learning LEGO¬Æ SPIKE‚Ñ¢ Prime with Python. This guide is designed to take young builders from absolute beginners to challenge-ready programmers through a structured, hands-on curriculum.

## How to Use This Guide
Simply download the index.html file and open it in any modern web browser. For the best experience, you can host this repository on GitHub Pages.

The application is divided into three main sections:

1. Introduction: Learn about the robot's hardware and the core programming concepts.

2. Curriculum: An interactive 6-class course with detailed explanations and code examples.

3. Cheat Sheet: A searchable, quick-reference guide for all essential commands.

## Part 1: Understanding Your Toolkit
Before you start coding, it's important to know your tools. The interactive guide provides details on the following components and concepts.

The Robot Parts
* üß† The Hub: The brain of your robot, containing the battery, light matrix, speaker, and built-in Gyro Sensor.

* ‚öôÔ∏è Motors: The muscles of your robot, used for movement and actions.

* üé® Color Sensor: The robot's eye, capable of detecting colors and light intensity.

* üåä Distance Sensor: The robot's sonar, using ultrasound to measure distance to objects.

* üëÜ Force Sensor: The robot's sense of touch, perfect for bumpers.

* üß≠ Gyro Sensor: Measures rotation, enabling precise turns and straight-line driving.

### Core Python Concepts
* import Statements: Bring the necessary Spike Prime code libraries into your program.

* Variables: Store information in named containers for clean, reusable code.

* Functions: Create named blocks of code for specific, repeatable tasks.

* Loops (for/while): Repeat sections of your code.

* Conditionals (if/else): Allow your robot to make decisions.

* Asynchronous Tasks (async/await): The key to making your robot do multiple things at once.

## Part 2: The 6-Class Curriculum
The core of the guide is a 6-class iterative curriculum. Each class builds upon the last, introducing new sensors and programming concepts with hands-on exercises.

* Class 1: Bringing Your Robot to Life

  * Goal: Learn the basics of movement, lights, sounds, and variables.

  * Concepts: Motors, Lights, Sounds, Variables.

* Class 2: Functions and Precision Movement

  * Goal: Organize code into reusable functions and make precise turns with the Gyro Sensor.

  * Concepts: Functions, Gyro Sensor.

* Class 3: Following Lines with the Color Sensor

  * Goal: Use the Color Sensor and Proportional Control to smoothly follow lines.

  * Concepts: Color Sensor, Proportional Control.

* Class 4: Physical Interaction & Navigation

  * Goal: Use the Force and Distance sensors to interact with the environment and navigate a maze.

  * Concepts: Force Sensor, Distance Sensor, Maze Logic.

* Class 5: Advanced Programming: Parallel Tasks

  * Goal: Make the robot do multiple things at once using async and await.

  * Concepts: Async/Await, Concurrency.

* Class 6: Ultimate Challenge: Competition Structure

  * Goal: Learn to structure code like a real robotics competition with modular "mission" functions.

  * Concepts: Modular Programming, Mission Launcher.

## Part 3: The Ultimate Challenge Cheat Sheet
The interactive guide includes a comprehensive and searchable cheat sheet covering all the functions and commands taught in the curriculum. Use the search filter in the app to quickly find what you need!
